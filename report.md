# OWASP 10 2021 - Summaries

## [A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/)
* 90% of the tested applications for some form misconfiguration, with an average incidence of 4%.
* We can consider that an application is vulnerable if it is:
  * Not enough security for application stack or cloud permissions are incorrect,
  * Functions installed or activated that are not needed,
  * The default accounts have not been secured (no password change or account deactivation),
  * Error messages are revealing too much information for the users,
  * Latest system upgrades are deactivated or not configured properly,
  * Server applications (Spring, Django, Struts, etc.) are not configured correctly,
  * Server does not send security headers, or they are not set as secure values,
  * Software is **out of date** or **vulnerable**.
* Avoid a misconfiguration by implementing security process:
  * Development, QA, and production should use the same configuration but with some different credentials,
  * Install only useful features or frameworks. Uninstall unnecessary features,
  * Create a process that analyzes and upgrade configurations based on upgrade, security notes, and patches. Review your cloud permissions,
  * Segmenting applications in the architecture, increases the components' security,
  * Use security headers to send directives to clients,
  * Verify the effectiveness of the configuration with automated processes.
* Possible scenarios
  * A server has a not removed application in the production environment. If a security failure exist and is known on this application, attackers can use it to trade-off the server. Depending of the application level, the impact can be more or less important.
  * A server returns detailed error messages to the users. It can expose sensitive data/information to everyone.

## [A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/)
* A vulnerable and outdated component is a common issue, that we have some difficulties to **test and evaluate** the risk.
* We can consider that you are vulnerable if:
  * You don't consider the versions of all your components (and dependencies) that you use,
  * Your OS or softwares are vulnerable, unsupported, or out of date,
  * You don't scan regularly for searching vulnerabilities or you do not susbcribe to a security bulletin about component security issues,
  * You don't upgrade or fix components or dependencies depending on the risks,
  * You use a software that developers do not test the compatibility of updated, upgraded, or patched libraries,
  * You don't secure your components.
* Avoid vulnarable component with a patch management process:
  * Delete and remove unnecessary features, softwares, components, dependencies,
  * Create a version inventory of your components and dependencies, and update it continuously,
  * Monitor continuously the Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) and National Vulnerability Database (NVD),
  * Use only official sources to obtain components or dependencies.
* Possible scenarios
  * A component is always run with the same authorizations as the main application, can cause serious impacts if the component has one or multiple flows.
